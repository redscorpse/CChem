# CChem
A docker container with tools for computational chemistry.

Includes

- Editor: vim with intelligense (coc) and other plugins
- Python: python3, ipython
    - pip packages: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, tensorflow, pyscf, psi4, (...)

I am using it from a Raspberry Pi 4, and I *will* push the ***arm64*** container to dockerhub [link here]().
The Dockerfile is for allowing to build the image on ***amd64*** architectures.
